                                        <li><b>Be welcoming</b>: Our community welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

                            <p>We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting <a href="mailto:conduct@lfai.foundation">conduct@lfai.foundation</a>. In your report please include:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Your contact information.</li>
                                    <li>Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.</li>
                                    <li>Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.</li>
                                    <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
                                </ol>
                            <p>All reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.</p>
                            <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.</p>
