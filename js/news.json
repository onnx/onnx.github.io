By joining the project, we plan to further expand the choices developers have on top of frameworks powered by the <a href='https://www.intelnervana.com/intel-nervana-graph/' class='link' target='_blank'>Intel® Nervana™</a> Graph library and deployment through our <a href='https://software.intel.com/en-us/dl-deployment-tool-devguide-introducing-intels-deep-learning-deployment-toolkit' class='link' target='_blank'>Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit</a>. Developers should have the freedom to choose the best software and hardware to build their artificial intelligence model and not be locked into one solution based on a framework. Deep learning is better when developers can move models from framework to framework and use the best hardware platform for the job. ",
