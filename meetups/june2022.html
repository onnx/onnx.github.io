                                        This event will be hosted in-person at the brand-new Microsoft Silicon Valley Campus on Friday, June 24th. There will be a livestream available for those that are unable to attend in person. The event will cover ONNX Community updates, partner and user stories, and plenty of community networking.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-2">
                                        The main conference track will include lightning talks showcasing the innovative ways ONNX is being used across the ecosystem. We will have a breakout room available all day to continue the conversation around individual topics that you would like to dive deeper into. To close out the day of learning we will have special topic round tables to get your questions answered, followed by an ONNX Runtime-hosted happy hour to relax and connect with the community.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-2">
                                        If you are using ONNX in your services and applications, building software or hardware that supports ONNX, or contributing to ONNX, you should attend! This is a great opportunity to meet with and hear from people working with ONNX and connect with this exciting and growing community!

                                                        Accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNN) inference is an important step in realizing latencycritical deployment of real-world applications such as image classification, image segmentation, 
                                                        natural language processing, etc. The need to improve DNN's inference latency has sparked 
                                                        interest in running those models in lower precisions, such as FP16 and INT8. In particular, 
                                                        running DNNs in INT8 precision can offer faster inference and a much lower memory footprint 
                                                        than its floating-point counterpart. [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) 
                                                        supports Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) techniques to convert floating-point DNN models 
                                                        to INT8 precision. In this talk, we shall demonstrate end-end workflow of converting Tensorflow 
                                                        QAT models into ONNX, which is a standard intermediate representation to deploy using 
                                                        TensorRT. We use TF2ONNX package to convert a quantized Tensorflow model into ONNX. 
                                                        ONNX format makes it easier to visualize graphs via netron which can provide users information

                                                        <br>
                                                        We present extensions to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) intermediate 
                                                        representation format to represent arbitrary-precision quantized neural networks. We first 
                                                        introduce support for low precision quantization in existing ONNX-based quantization formats 
                                                        by leveraging integer clipping, resulting in two new backward-compatible variants: the 
                                                        quantized operator format with clipping and quantize-clip-dequantize (QCDQ) format. We then 
                                                        introduce a novel higher-level ONNX format called quantized ONNX (QONNX) that introduces 
                                                        three new operators —Quant, BipolarQuant, and Trunc— in order to represent uniform 
                                                        quantization. By keeping the QONNX IR high-level and flexible, we enable targeting a wider 
                                                        variety of platforms. We also present utilities for working with QONNX, as well as examples of 
                                                        its usage in the FINN and hls4ml toolchains. Finally, we introduce the QONNX model zoo to 
                                                        share low precision quantized neural networks.

                                                        <br>
                                                        AI is revolutionising many fields from healthcare to biometrics these recent years. However due 
                                                        to security and privacy concerns, data is still being siloed and not shared enough due to the fear 
                                                        of data exposure and IP leakage. Confidential Computing is a recent technology that enables 
                                                        end-to-end encryption when analysing sensitive data. By leveraging Confidential Computing, 
                                                        data owners can share their data to AI companies, for instance to train or consume an AI model, 
                                                        without ever risking their data being stolen, leaked or used for any other purpose, as data 
                                                        remains protected even when shared to third parties. This talk aims to introduce the high level 
                                                        principles of Confidential Computing and how it can be used to deploy privacy friendly AI 
                                                        models. We will present BlindAI (https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai), an AI deployment

                                                        The space of AI is growing rapidly. At this pace, it can be challenging for key AI stakeholders to 
                                                        identify and address social and regulatory concerns with AI, motivating the need for tools and 
                                                        methods to approach AI ethics challenges. A popular approach in the responsible AI space is 
                                                        using metadata to encode a “model card,” a versatile report detailing the configuration, ethical

                                                        to enable transparency and fairness of the use case, filtering of high-quality AI models, pain

                                                        ORT provides the foundations for inference for Adobe's audio and video products (Premiere 
                                                        Pro, After Effects, Character Animator) on both Mac and Windows. In this talk, we'll discuss how 
                                                        ORT with the DML backend is essential in enabling high-throughput inference for audio and 
                                                        video workflows on Windows, and how we use ORT to enable speech to text on Mac.

                                                        Video workflows are unique because of the sheer amount of data they process; our customers 
                                                        frequently ingest high resolution video >= 4k@60fps of which each frame may need to be 
                                                        passed through our models. Likewise, video workflows are inherently resource limited: the GPU 
                                                        is also being used for hardware decode and render at the same time.

                                                        ORT gives us the tools to build complex frameworks and workflows on top of so that we can 
                                                        deliver ML-based features while ensuring that we're able to provide the best experience for our

                                                        use ONNX models as an interchange format. Qualcomm helps to deploy and accelerate natural language processing,

                                                        the Intermediate Representation format. PFVM is used in production environments to deploy
