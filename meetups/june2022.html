                                        This event will be hosted in-person at the brand-new Microsoft Silicon Valley Campus on Friday, June 24th. There will be a livestream available for those that are unable to attend in person. The event will cover ONNX Community updates, partner and user stories, and plenty of community networking.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-2">
                                        The main conference track will include lightning talks showcasing the innovative ways ONNX is being used across the ecosystem. We will have a breakout room available all day to continue the conversation around individual topics that you would like to dive deeper into. To close out the day of learning we will have special topic round tables to get your questions answered, followed by an ONNX Runtime-hosted happy hour to relax and connect with the community.
                                    </p>

                                        If you are using ONNX in your services and applications, building software or hardware that supports ONNX, or contributing to ONNX, you should attend! This is a great opportunity to meet with and hear from people working with ONNX and connect with this exciting and growing community!

                                                        <br>
                                                        Accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNN) inference is an important step in realizing latencycritical deployment of real-world applications such as image classification, image segmentation, 
                                                        natural language processing, etc. The need to improve DNN's inference latency has sparked 
                                                        interest in running those models in lower precisions, such as FP16 and INT8. In particular, 
                                                        running DNNs in INT8 precision can offer faster inference and a much lower memory footprint 
                                                        than its floating-point counterpart. [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) 
                                                        supports Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) techniques to convert floating-point DNN models 
                                                        to INT8 precision. In this talk, we shall demonstrate end-end workflow of converting Tensorflow 
                                                        QAT models into ONNX, which is a standard intermediate representation to deploy using 
                                                        TensorRT. We use TF2ONNX package to convert a quantized Tensorflow model into ONNX. 
                                                        ONNX format makes it easier to visualize graphs via netron which can provide users information 
                                                        about placement of quantized nodes.

                                                        <br>
                                                        We present extensions to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) intermediate 
                                                        representation format to represent arbitrary-precision quantized neural networks. We first 
                                                        introduce support for low precision quantization in existing ONNX-based quantization formats 
                                                        by leveraging integer clipping, resulting in two new backward-compatible variants: the 
                                                        quantized operator format with clipping and quantize-clip-dequantize (QCDQ) format. We then 
                                                        introduce a novel higher-level ONNX format called quantized ONNX (QONNX) that introduces 
                                                        three new operators —Quant, BipolarQuant, and Trunc— in order to represent uniform 
                                                        quantization. By keeping the QONNX IR high-level and flexible, we enable targeting a wider 
                                                        variety of platforms. We also present utilities for working with QONNX, as well as examples of 
                                                        its usage in the FINN and hls4ml toolchains. Finally, we introduce the QONNX model zoo to 
                                                        share low precision quantized neural networks.
