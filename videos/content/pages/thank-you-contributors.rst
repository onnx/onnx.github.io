:title: Thank You

Early 2016 (January 19th to be exact), serious work began on a new PyVideo.
The goal was to carry a torch that was at risk of going out
(see `Welcome to the new PyVideo`_). Before PyCon 2016, the new site was a
humble skeleton of what it is now. The data -- although a tremendous archive,
with over 3,000 videos catalogued -- was a fraction of what is now. As PyCon 2016
hit, a team of 20-plus developers sprinted together to ensure this
work was not lost.

Now, years later, we have a statically generated site with many thousands of
videos and counting.

This simply would not have been possible without the support of the
Python community. Here is a link to just a few of the developers that
have chipped in their time:

These developers are hardworking, kind, and supportive.
I'm fortunate to work with such a wonderful team.

So, finally, thank you.

Together we've created a resource that helps Python developers at all
levels hone their skills and move toward the developers they want to be.
