Thank You
---------

Towards the beginning of 2016, Will and Sheila decided to step down as
maintainers of pyvideo.org. You can read more about why they stepped down at
`Will's blog`_.

Prior to stepping down, Will and Sheila spent years building out
and maintaining pyvideo.org (Will's first commit was in May, 2010).
Their tireless efforts are the reason we have such a rich collection of
videos indexed today. It's because of this work that thousands can learn
and grow with Python who may not have been able to do so before. Thank you.

What Now
--------

Will and Sheila's work will continue but at a slightly different repo.

For now, work is continuing at https://github.com/pyvideo/pyvideo and
https://github.com/pyvideo/data. The first repo contains the code that is used
to build this static site. The second repo contains the all the data that
is present on this site.

Both repos are completely volunteer driven and help is welcome. If you're
interested in helping out and want to ask a few questions, feel free to join
us on our two gitter.im channels.
