    "description": "Integrating machine learning into enterprises requires building and deploying ML models in the environments enterprises build their software in. Frequently this is in Java, or another language running on the JVM. In this talk we'll cover some of our recent work bringing the ONNX ecosystem to Java. We'll discuss uses of ONNX Runtime from Java, and also our work writing model converters from our Java ML library into ONNX format. ",
