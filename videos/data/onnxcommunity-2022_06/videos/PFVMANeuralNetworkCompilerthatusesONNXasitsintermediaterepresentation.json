    "description": "PFVM is a neural network compiler developed by Preferred Networks, which relies on ONNX as the Intermediate Representation format. PFVM is used in production environments to deploy models to various devices such as GPUs, multiple edge computing architectures, and PFN's own accelerator, MN-Core. PFVM's most salient features are; automatic checkpointing, operator fusion, and graph simplification that can be applied even when models have dynamic axes or unknown shapes. ONNX Shape inference becomes a critical element for all these optimizations, and the importance of bringing up more advanced shape inference mechanisms to address complex optimization scenarios is discussed in this talk.",
