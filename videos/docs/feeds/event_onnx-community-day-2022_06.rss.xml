In this talk, we'll discuss how ORT with the DML backend is essential in enabling high-throughput inference for audio and video workflows on Windows, and how we use ORT to enable speech to text on Mac. Video workflows are unique because of the sheer amount of data they process; our customers frequently ingest high resolution video &amp;gt;= &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:4k&amp;#64;60fps"&gt;4k&amp;#64;60fps&lt;/a&gt; of which each frame may need to be passed through our models. Likewise, video workflows are inherently resource limited: the GPU is also being used for hardware decode and render at the same time. ORT gives us the tools to build complex frameworks and workflows on top of so that we can deliver ML-based features while ensuring that we're able to provide the best experience for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

However due to security and privacy concerns, data is still being siloed and not shared enough due to the fear of data exposure and IP leakage. Confidential Computing is a recent technology that enables end-to-end encryption when analysing sensitive data. By leveraging Confidential Computing, data owners can share their data to AI companies, for instance to train or consume an AI model, without ever risking their data being stolen, leaked or used for any other purpose, as data remains protected even when shared to third parties. This talk aims to introduce the high level principles of Confidential Computing and how it can be used to deploy privacy friendly AI models. We will present BlindAI, an AI deployment solution, serving ONNX models with privacy guarantees, and see how it can be used to unlock confidential medical document analysis in the Cloud, or facial recognition with privacy guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, running DNNs in INT8 precision can offer faster inference and a much lower memory footprint than its floating-point counterpart. NVIDIA TensorRT supports Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) techniques to convert floating-point DNN models to INT8 precision. In this talk, we shall demonstrate end-end workflow of converting Tensorflow QAT models into ONNX, which is a standard intermediate representation to deploy using TensorRT. We use TF2ONNX package to convert a quantized Tensorflow model into ONNX. ONNX format makes it easier to visualize graphs via netron which can provide users information about placement of quantized nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

PFVM is used in production environments to deploy models to various devices such as GPUs, multiple edge computing architectures, and PFN's own accelerator, MN-Core. PFVM's most salient features are; automatic checkpointing, operator fusion, and graph simplification that can be applied even when models have dynamic axes or unknown shapes. ONNX Shape inference becomes a critical element for all these optimizations, and the importance of bringing up more advanced shape inference mechanisms to address complex optimization scenarios is discussed in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

We first introduce support for low precision quantization in existing ONNX-based quantization formats by leveraging integer clipping, resulting in two new backward-compatible variants: the quantized operator format with clipping and quantize-clip-dequantize (QCDQ) format. We then introduce a novel higher-level ONNX format called quantized ONNX (QONNX) that introduces three new operators —Quant, BipolarQuant, and Trunc— in order to represent uniform quantization. By keeping the QONNX IR high-level and flexible, we enable targeting a wider variety of platforms. We also present utilities for working with QONNX, as well as examples of its usage in the FINN and hls4ml toolchains. Finally, we introduce the QONNX model zoo to share low precision quantized neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

At this pace, it can be challenging for key AI stakeholders to identify and address social and regulatory concerns with AI, motivating the need for tools and methods to approach AI ethics challenges. A popular approach in the responsible AI space is using metadata to encode a “model card,” a versatile report detailing the configuration, ethical considerations, limitations, and quantitative analysis of an AI model. This approach can be used to enable transparency and fairness of the use case, filtering of high-quality AI models, pain point identification in AI pipelines, and help with establishing compliance and lineage. In this session, we will present our proposal and end-to-end proof of concept for metadata fields and model cards incorporated in Onnx to capture aspects of the model such as provenance &amp;amp; mixed precision representation.&lt;/p&gt;

Qualcomm helps to deploy and accelerate natural language processing, computer vision, classification, segmentation, and transformer based models in various verticals: Mobile, IoT, XR, Compute and Automotive. We created a link between ONNX and Qualcomm AI Engine direct that allows us to run the same model not only on various backends such as CPU, GPU, Hexagon processor or Low Power AI subsystem of the same SoC, and migrate it to run on range of the devices due to the portability that ONNX provides.
