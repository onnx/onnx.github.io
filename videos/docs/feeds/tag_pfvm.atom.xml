PFVM is used in production environments to deploy models to various devices such as GPUs, multiple edge computing architectures, and PFN's own accelerator, MN-Core. PFVM's most salient features are; automatic checkpointing, operator fusion, and graph simplification that can be applied even when models have dynamic axes or unknown shapes. ONNX Shape inference becomes a critical element for all these optimizations, and the importance of bringing up more advanced shape inference mechanisms to address complex optimization scenarios is discussed in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
